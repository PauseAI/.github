# PauseAI

We are a community of volunteers and local communities coordinated by a non-profit that aims to mitigate the risks of AI (including the risk of human extinction). We aim to convince our governments to step in and pause the development of superhuman AI. We do this by informing the public, talking to decision-makers, and organizing protests.

See [pauseai.info](https://pauseai.info) for more information.
